# New in Java8
Java8 released with many new exciting features, some of these are:
- Lambda expressions
- Functional interfaces
- Streams API
- Optional 
- New Date/Time API
- Declarative programming with Lambdas and Functional interfaces

## Code Examples

- ### [Declarative Vs Imperative Programming](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/tree/master/src/java8/declarativeprogramming)<br/>
    In declarative approach we focus on what to get, OR simply our concern is Result not logic, we don't look what's happening behind the walls. In declarative style we just have to find and call pre-define/built-in functions. Declarative style is just like SQL. <br/>For more details about this have a look on **[Example 01](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/declarativeprogramming/DeclarativeProgrammingExample01.java)** and **[Example 02](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/declarativeprogramming/DeclarativeProgrammingExample02.java)** 
  
- ###  [Lambda Expressions](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/tree/master/src/java8/lambda)<br/>
    Lambdas are functions without names, also known as Anonymous functions, they can have Method Parameters, Method Body, and Return types. Lambdas are independent functions, they are not related to any class. Lambdas can be assigned & passed out to other functions.<br/> A lambda consist of three parts: **() -> {}**  <br/> 1. **()** Lambda Parameters<br/>2. **->** Lambda Arrow Separator <br/> 3. **{}** Lambda Body<br/> Lambdas are mainly used for implementations of functional interfaces. <br/> For code examples please have a look on **[Example 01](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/lambda/LambdaRunnableImplementation.java)** and  **[Example 02](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/lambda/LambdaComparatorImplementation.java)**    

- ###  [Functional Interfaces](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/tree/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces)<br/>
    Interfaces that have only one abstract method, but they can have multiple default methods. Functional Interfaces introduced in Java8. <br/> **@FunctionalInterface** is an optional annotation can be used with functional interfaces to make sure that an interface is not breaking the rule i.e Only a single abstract method. <br/> Four types of new functional interfaces were introduced in java8 which are:
     - #### Consumer 
       A Functional Interface with one abstract method named "accept" and one default method named "andThen". The "accept" method takes one argument, performs action on it, and returns nothing. Usually Consumer Interface used where return value is not needed.<br/> For more details about Consumer Interface please have a look on this [**Code Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/ConsumerFunctionalInterfaceExample.java)<br/>
       **BiConsumer** is extension of Consumer, BiConsumer is similar to the Consumer Interface the only difference is BiConsumer accepts two arguments, while Consumer has one argument. Please have a look on this [**BiConsumer Interface Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/BiConsumerFunctionalInterfaceExample.java)
     - #### Predicate
       A Functional Interface accepts one argument and returns a boolean, also has 3 default methods based on "and", "or" and "negate" switches. See the  **[Code Example](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/PredicateFunctionalInterfaceExample.java)** for more details.<br/>
       **BiPredicate** is extension of Predicate, BiPredicate is same as predicate except it has two inputs while Predicate has only one. Please check this [**BiPredicate Code Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/BiPredicateFunctionalInterfaceExample.java) for more details.  
     - #### Function 
        Function is a Functional Interface, introduced in java8, has an abstract method 'apply', three default methods 'andThen', 'compose' and 'identity'. This interface is same as a function, takes one input of type T, and returns output of type R. <br/>Implementing this interface will be same as creating method in java. Return type of Function has to be passed as 2nd input while creating the object i.e Function<Integer,Double>, here the 2nd parameter which is double in this example Double will be the return type of this function. Check this [**Code Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/FunctionFunctionalInterfaceExample.java) to see the implementation of this interface.<br/>
        **BiFunction** is extension of Function interface, BiFunction accepts two inputs and returns a value of required type. Check [**BiFunction Code Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/BiFunctionFunctionalInterfaceExample.java) for more details. <br/>
        **UnaryOperator** is a type of Function interface, UnaryOperator is a functional interface which extends Function interface. We can use this interface instead of Function, where we know that input and output are going to be of same type. See this [**UnaryOperator Code Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/UnaryOperatorFunctionalInterfaceExample.java) for more details. <br/>
        **BinaryOperator** is a type of Function interface, BinaryOperator is a functional interface which extends BiFunction interface. We can use this interface instead of BiFunction, where we know that both inputs and output are going to be of same type. Check this [**BinaryOperator Code Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/BinaryOperatorFunctionalInterfaceExample.java) for more details.
     - #### Supplier
        Supplier is a Functional Interface, introduced in java8.  It takes no input and returns a value of type T, has only one abstract method 'get()'. This interface is inverted version of Consumer interface which takes one argument and returns nothing, while it takes nothings and return a value. See this [**Code Example**](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/functionalinterfaces/SupplierFunctionalInterfaceExample.java) for more details.  
        
- ###  [Method Reference](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/tree/master/src/java8/methodreferences)<br/>
    We can simplify the implementation of Functional Interface using Method references
    , Introduced in java8. They are shorthand syntax of Lambda expressions. We can use them to replace Lambda expressions, and here we don't need to pass the arguments manually, If the method accepts arguments they passed automatically behind the scenes. <br/> Syntax of Method references is **ClassName::methodName**.
