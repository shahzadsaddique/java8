- New Date/Time API
- Declarative programming with Lambdas and Functional interfaces

## Code Examples

- ### [Declarative Vs Imperative Programming](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/tree/master/src/java8/declarativeprogramming)
  > In this approach we focus on what to get,OR simply our concerns is Results not logic, we don't look what's happening behind the walls. In declarative style we just have to find and call pre-define/built-in functions. Declarative style is just like SQL. For more details about this have a look on **[Example 01](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/declarativeprogramming/DeclarativeProgrammingExample01.java)** and **[Example 02](https://github.com/shahzadsaddique/java8/blob/master/src/java8/declarativeprogramming/DeclarativeProgrammingExample02.java)**
